		<h1>Lab 11: Libraries & jQuery</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>
		It was challenging to have the color change to be apparent immediately, although
		this was mainly due to my failure to have the correct function. I made a careless mistake
		in both html and css.
		</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>
		The problem I had working on this lab was to have a button appearing on a local site.
		I could not have the button appear in the first attempt because I added an unnecessarily
		quotation in one of the codes.
		</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>
		Click buttons to see the result! Enjoy the colorful experience.
