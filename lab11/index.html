			<h1>Lab 11:Libraries and jQuery</h1>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>
				It was challenging to have the color change to be apparant immediately, although
				this was mainly due to my failure to have the correct function.
			</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>
			The problem I had working on this lab was to have a button appearing on local site.
			I could not have the button apear in the first attempt because I added an unnecessarily
			quotation in one of the codes.
			</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>
				Click buttons to see result! Enjoy the colorful experience.
