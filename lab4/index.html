	<h2>Challenge</h2>
	<p>
		Some challenges of this lab was to locate the pseudocode comment in the right place.
		My partner had to remind me that the author block and JS comment are two separate things
		because author block will be places in the javascript file while the JS comment while,
		be pasted on the html. Also, pasting the results in the results section below was very
		challening because you'll need to make extra arrangements from the original copy.
