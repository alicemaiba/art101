	<h2>Challenge</h2>
	<p>
		Some challenges of this lab was to locate the pseudocode comment in the right place.
		My partner had to remind me that the author block and JS comment are two separate things
		because author block will be places in the javascript file while the JS comment while,
		be pasted on the html. Also, pasting the results in the results section below was very
		challening because you'll need to make extra arrangements from the original copy.
	</p>
	<h2> Problems</h2>
	<p>
		The problem I had while working on this page was linking the css to this page.
		I spent extra time to figure out how to apply the css application and my partner point it out how
		I misspelled the code. Now I am satisfied.
