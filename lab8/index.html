		<h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>
			I again had some challenges with the javascript where I could
			not have the results show up in the first attempt. The main reasons
			for this failure was wrong formatting because some lines were
			not indented correctly. My partner again pointed me out which part
			was missing.
		</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>If you check the console, you can see the output!</p>
