		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>
			I again had some challenges with the javascript where I could
			not have the results show up in the first attempt. Tha main reasons
			for this failure was wrong formatting because some lines were
			not indented correctly.
		</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>
			I was able to get the script output correctly.
