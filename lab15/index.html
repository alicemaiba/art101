		<h1>Lab 15: AJAX</h1>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>
					The challenge of this lab was to find the correct api source and manage in a way that the img
					of any poemon will show as the visitor enters.
				</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>
						Some problems I had was that the css and js did not show on local even though the
						html worked fine so I had to make my partner wait till it showed up on my local.
					</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>
						You can choose your favorite pokemon and see an official art!
