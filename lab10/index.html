			<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>
					I took a while finding out on how to declare an arry
					myTransport and object myMainRide on JavaScript Console
					with the correct format. The two careless mistakes I had was
					using "=" instead of ":" and forgetting to add "," after every indentation.
				</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>
					I was able to have the object working by referencing object properties
					and having the correct result.
